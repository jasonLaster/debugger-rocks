# Hackable

Built for web devs by web devs. Designed to be hackable and extendable by anyone.

## Simple Setup

Getting started is as simple as three commands `git clone`, `yarn`, `yarn start`.

## Modern Stack

Redesigned in React and Redux. Every component in the Debugger is a React component. Every action in the Debugger is a Redux action.
Incredibly testable, modular, and hackable.

## Tested and Typed

We use Jest to test components and actions, which make it easy to TDD any part of the application in isolation.
We've typed the debugger with Flow, which automatically checks any change for type consistency.

## Local Development

With webpack development server, hacking on the debugger is just like hacking on any other website. You can even debug it in Chrome if that's your cup of tea!

## Github

Hosted in Github, the Debugger is easy to fork, clone, and make pull requests. Claiming an issue to work on is as easy as commenting `/claim`!

# Frameworks + Libraries

The Firefox Debugger is the best choice for React, Angular, Vue developers.

## Breakpoints and Stepping

Fine tuned for modern source map driven development.
Breakpoints will be added to the correct location and will stay there as the code changes.
The first debugger to use Babel to decide where to step, which means you can step with confidence even in source mapped files.

## Components

See components in a whole new light with the component outline.
See component state and props in the component pane when paused.

## Call Stacks

Call Stacks that organize the library frames so you can see your app in context.
Call Stacks will soon show parent components on pause.

# Community

The debugger has benefited from a community 500+ strong and always eager to help teach, share, and mentor.

## Core Team

The core team of community volunteers are available around the world to help mentor and get you started.

## Slack

You can find us in our public slack. All questions are welcome. Don't forget to stop by our `#random`, `#pets` and other channels too!

## A place to learn

In addition to building a Debugger, we hope the project is a place where people can come to improve their skills, whether it be testing, typing, UI development, accessibility, JS language knowledge, or community management.
